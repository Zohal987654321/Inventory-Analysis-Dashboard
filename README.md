# Inventory-Analysis-Dashboard
Effective inventory tracking is essential for businesses to streamline supply chains and minimize inefficiencies. By conducting regular stocktakes, monitoring inventory turnover, and keeping track of aged and overstocked items, businesses can enhance operational efficiency, allocate resources strategically, and improve cash flow management.

This project is a showcase of an inventory management dashboard, designed to provide valuable insights and optimize inventory planning. 

It incorporates advanced features to improve user experience, including pagination with customizable item counts for tables containing extensive item lists. This feature offers a more user-friendly interface by reducing the need for excessive scrolling when preferred, while also displaying item rankings for added convenience.
