‚ú¥Ô∏è Stock-to-Sales Ratio ‚Äì Compares stock levels to sales.
Analogy: A store stocking winter coats in summer (high ratio, bad) vs. just enough stock for demand (low ratio, good).
Formula: Inventory Value / Sales Value

Analogy: Fresh fruits need quick sales (low DSI), while canned food can sit longer (high DSI).
Formula: (Average Inventory / COGS) √ó 365

‚ú¥Ô∏è Order Accuracy Rate ‚Äì How often correct items are delivered.
Analogy: Ordering a pizza and getting the right toppings (high accuracy) vs. wrong order mistakes (low accuracy).
Formula: (Correct Orders / Total Orders) √ó 100
